# 🚀 Project Requirements

## Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications
* **Data Sources:** Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
* **Data Quality:** Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
* **Integration:** Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
* **Scope:** Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
* **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
  
# BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

### Objective

Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

- Customer Behavior
- Product Performance
- Sales Trends

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.

# Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze** , **Silver** , and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
